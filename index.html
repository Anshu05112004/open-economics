Ths project aims to predict the optimal time for a country to buy oil from OPEC in order to obtain more oil at a cheaper rate and prevent economic recession. The prediction is done using logistic regression, a statistical method that can be used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

		The project is made by Abhineet Raj. It aims to predict the optimal time for a country to buy oil from OPEC in order to obtain more oil at a cheaper rate and prevent economic recession. The prediction is done using logistic regression, a statistical method that can be used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
		<br>
		To make this prediction, the project collects data on the oil prices declared by OPEC for the last 10 days, the currency value of the user's country with respect to the dollar, and the oil consumption of the user's country. This data is then preprocessed and analyzed to identify relevant features that can be used to predict the optimal time to buy oil from OPEC.
		<br>
		The project uses logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome, which in this case is whether or not the country should buy oil from OPEC at a given time. The logistic regression model is trained on historical data to identify patterns and relationships between the predictor variables and the binary outcome.
		<br>
		Once the logistic regression model has been trained, it can be used to predict the optimal time for a country to buy oil from OPEC based on the current values of the predictor variables. The model can help countries make informed decisions about when to buy oil from OPEC in order to prevent economic recession and ensure a stable supply of oil.
